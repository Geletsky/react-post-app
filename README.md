<h1 align="center">React Post App</h1>

## Description:
This project is a React application focused on the functionality of managing posts. It allows users to add and delete posts, search and filter posts, and navigate through pages using pagination.  The primary focus of this project is on functionality rather than design.

The application utilizes various React hooks, including `useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, and `useNavigate`, to achieve the desired functionality.	

## Features:

- **Adding and Deleting Posts**: Users can create new posts by filling out a form and submitting it. Existing posts can be deleted with the click of a button.

- **Searching and Filtering Posts**: The application provides a search bar where users can enter keywords to search for specific posts. Additionally, posts can be filtered based on certain criteria, allowing users to narrow down their search results.

- **Pagination and Page Navigation**: The list of posts is paginated, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages. Pagination controls are provided for easy navigation between pages.

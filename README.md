<h1 align="center">React Post App</h1>

<p align="center">An application that allows you to effectively manage publications, search and filter.</p>

## Description:

This project is a React application that focuses on publishing management functionality. The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust set of features for managing the publishing process, with an emphasis on functionality rather than design.

The application utilizes several key React interceptors, including `useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, and `useNavigate`, to achieve the desired functionality. These interceptors play a crucial role in managing the state, optimizing performance, handling side effects, and navigating between different sections of the application.

## Features:

- **Publishing Management:** The application provides a set of tools and functions for effective management of publishing tasks. Users can create, edit and delete publications.

- **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for specific posts and apply filters to narrow down the displayed content. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling quick access to relevant publications.

- **User-friendly Interface:** Although the primary focus of the project is on functionality, the application strives to provide a user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience. The UI design is kept simple and intuitive, allowing users to navigate through different sections seamlessly.

- **State Management:** The use of React's useState hook ensures efficient state management within components. This allows for real-time updates and proper synchronization of data, enabling users to interact with the application smoothly.

- **Performance Optimization:** By utilizing the useMemo hook, the application optimizes performance by memoizing expensive calculations. This minimizes unnecessary re-renders and enhances the overall responsiveness of the application.

- **Navigation:** The useNavigate hook empowers users to navigate through different sections of the application effortlessly. Users can switch between views, access publication details, and return to previous screens using familiar browser-like navigation.
